# Network Services Laboratory



Discover the secrets of this <a href="Practice1_Network_Services_Laboratory.pdf" target="_blank">project</a> as it unfolds the establishment of a structured network with WAN, LAN, and DMZ segments. The powerful "pfSense" firewall takes center stage, overseeing and regulating network management.

Nowadays, modern companies are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks that exploit network services, such as code injection, buffer overflow and authentication bypass. These vulnerabilities pose a significant threat, as they can result in data breaches, financial losses and reputational damage. Addressing this problem requires the creation of a secure and controlled environment dedicated to perform vulnerability assessments on these services, ultimately aiming to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

Network services implemented:
- **Web Server:** "Wordpress Bitnami"
- **Storage Server:** "TrueNAS Scale"
- **Network Clients:** "Kali Linux"

This network architecture creates a laboratory environment, a playground for vulnerability assessments and analysis using the capabilities of "Kali Linux."
